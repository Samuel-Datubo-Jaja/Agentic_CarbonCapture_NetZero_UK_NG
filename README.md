# Agentic_CarbonCapture_NetZero_UK_NG

# 🌍 Project Summary: UK-Nigeria Carbon Capture Agent
## 🔹 Project Name:
UK-Nigeria Carbon Capture Agent
A multi-agent AI system for carbon monitoring, strategy, and compliance across the UK and Nigeria.

## 🔹 Objective:
To design and deploy an intelligent agentic system that supports carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) efforts by:

Monitoring emissions and storage sites,
Recommending capture strategies,
Ensuring regulatory compliance,
Enhancing decision-making with AI and real-time data.

## 🔹 Motivation:
Carbon capture is critical to both the UK’s Net-Zero 2050 target and Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan. However, current CCUS operations often face challenges in:
Real-time monitoring and early leak detection,
Regulatory navigation and transparency,
Site selection and techno-economic evaluation,
Cross-border knowledge and policy transfer.

This project bridges those gaps by combining:
Chemical engineering expertise,
Agentic AI systems, and
Geopolitical context awareness.
